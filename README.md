# Evol_16S

Quantifying the combinatoric and evolutionary constrains on microbial diversity using the 16S rRNA sequence.  

### Sections

#### combinatorics

Clustering random DNA sequences in Mothur.

#### phylogeny

Estimating the site-specific substitution rate from a 16S rRNA alignment + phylogeny.

#### secondary_structure

Analyzing the secondary structure of 16S rRNA DNA sequences (just data, no Python code at the moment).

#### tertiary_structure

Analyzing the tertiary structure of 16S rRNA  using Pyrosetta. 

#### simulation

Some old code for using Mothur. Keeping it in here and out of the way until I sort it out.
